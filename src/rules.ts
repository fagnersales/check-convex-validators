  },
  SEQUENTIAL_CTX_RUN: {
    title: "Multiple sequential ctx.runMutation calls in an action",
    category: "performance",
    why: "Each ctx.runMutation is its own transaction. Running several in sequence is slower than one combined mutation and gives up atomicity — a failure halfway through leaves the earlier writes committed.",

  NONDETERMINISTIC_QUERY: {
    title: "Nondeterministic value in a query",
    category: "reactivity",
    why: "Queries are cached and recomputed only when their inputs change. A value from Date.now() / Math.random() / new Date() is fixed at execution time, so the result never updates as wall-clock time passes — clients see stale data.",

  MISSING_ARG_VALIDATOR: {
    title: "Public function has no argument validator",
    category: "best-practice",

    why: "Convex's best-practices guide says to ensure every ctx.runQuery/runMutation/runAction and ctx.scheduler call uses `internal.*`, not `api.*`. A public function is callable by any client (a potential attacker), so a server-internal step left on `api.*` keeps an attack-surface function exposed instead of locking it down as internal.",

  FLOATING_CTX_PROMISE: {
    title: "Un-awaited Convex call (floating promise)",
    category: "correctness",
    why: "Convex ctx calls (ctx.db.patch, ctx.scheduler.runAfter, ctx.runMutation, …) return promises. Left un-awaited at statement position, the write or schedule may never run and any error is swallowed, so the bug surfaces as silently-missing data rather than a thrown exception.",

  FETCH_IN_QUERY: {
    title: "`fetch()` inside a query or mutation",
    category: "correctness",

    fixHint: "Move the third-party call into an `action`, and have it call queries/mutations for the data it needs.",
    docUrl: DOC_QUERY_FNS,
  },
  DB_IN_ACTION: {
    title: "`ctx.db` accessed inside an action",
    category: "correctness",
    why: "Actions don't get a database handle — `ActionCtx` has no `db`. Actions read and write the database only by calling queries and mutations via ctx.runQuery / ctx.runMutation. `ctx.db.*` in an action is a runtime error (and usually a query body pasted into an action).",

  QUERY_IN_NODE_FILE: {
    title: "Query or mutation in a `\"use node\"` file",
    category: "correctness",
    why: "A `\"use node\"` file is bundled for the Node.js runtime, which can only host actions. A query or mutation defined there can't run, and Convex rejects the deploy.",
    fixHint: "Move the query/mutation into a file without `\"use node\"`; keep only actions (and their Node helpers) in the Node file.",
    docUrl: DOC_RUNTIMES,
  },
  NODE_BUILTIN_WITHOUT_USE_NODE: {
    title: "Node builtin imported without `\"use node\"`",
    category: "runtime",
    why: "Convex's default V8 isolate has no Node.js builtins. Importing `node:fs`, `path`, `child_process`, etc. in a file with no `\"use node\"` directive fails when the module loads — at deploy or first call.",
    fixHint: "Add `\"use node\";` to the top of the file (only actions can live there), or replace the builtin with a runtime-neutral alternative.",
    docUrl: DOC_RUNTIMES,
  },
  MISPLACED_USE_NODE: {
    title: "`\"use node\"` not at the top of the file",
    category: "runtime",
    why: "The bundler only reads directives in the file prologue. A `\"use node\"` placed after an import or statement is silently ignored, so the file is treated as a V8 file and its Node code fails — with no error pointing at the misplaced directive.",
    fixHint: "Move `\"use node\";` to the very top of the file, above all imports and statements.",
    docUrl: DOC_RUNTIMES,
  },
  CRON_PUBLIC_FN: {
    title: "Cron job schedules a public `api.*` function",
    category: "best-practice",
    why: "The best-practices guide says to check crons.ts and ensure scheduled functions use `internal.*`, not `api.*`. A cron pointing at a public function keeps a server-internal step exposed on your public API, where any client can invoke it.",
    fixHint: "Make the cron's target an internal* function and reference it as `internal.<module>.<fn>`.",
    docUrl: DOC_INTERNAL_FNS,
  },
  DUPLICATE_CRON_ID: {
    title: "Two cron jobs share the same identifier",
    category: "correctness",
    why: "Each cron registration's first argument is a unique identifier. Registering two with the same name makes Convex throw \"Cron identifier registered twice\" and abort the deploy.",
    fixHint: "Give each cron job a distinct identifier string.",
    docUrl: DOC_CRONS,
  },
  CTX_RUN_IN_QUERY_OR_MUTATION: {
    title: "`ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation` inside a query or mutation",
    category: "performance",
    why: "Inside a query or mutation these run in the same transaction, so they add overhead with no consistency benefit over a plain TypeScript function. (Calling components, or wanting partial rollback in a mutation, are the documented exceptions.)",
    fixHint: "Extract the shared logic into a plain TypeScript helper (e.g. in convex/model) and call it directly.",
    docUrl: DOC_RUN_SPARINGLY,
  },
  REDUNDANT_INDEX: {
    title: "Index field list is a prefix of another index",
    category: "performance",
    why: "An index whose ordered fields are a prefix of another index on the same table is usually redundant — the longer index already serves prefix lookups. The short one costs storage and slows writes. (Keep it only if you rely on its distinct _creationTime ordering within the prefix.)",
    fixHint: "Drop the shorter index and use the longer one; it answers the same prefix queries.",
    docUrl: DOC_REDUNDANT_INDEX,
  },
  SCHEMA_VALIDATION_DISABLED: {
    title: "Schema validation disabled",
    category: "best-practice",
    why: "With `schemaValidation: false`, Convex no longer checks that stored documents match your schema, so the schema becomes documentation rather than an enforced contract — and ccv's own drift detection assumes rows conform to the schema.",
    fixHint: "Re-enable schema validation once your data conforms (this flag is meant as a temporary escape hatch during migrations).",
